Lots of little programs, useful to learn or teach programming.
All programs are test-driven, unless explicitly mentioned.

## The three laws of TDD by Robert C. Martin:
- You are not allowed to write any production code unless you have first written a failing test.
- You are not allowed to write more test code than is sufficient to fail (and not compiling is failing).
- You are not alloed to write more production code than is sufficient to make the currently failing test pass.

## 4 rules of simple design by Kent Beck & Martin Fowler:
- Passes the tests
- communicates intent
- No duplication
- Fewest elements
