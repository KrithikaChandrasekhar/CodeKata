## 'head'
`head` is a unix program that reads data from a file and display the beginning of files as output.

# Test strategy
- We are re-implementing an existing program. Our aim is to ensure that given same input, our program should produce same output as per golden master rule.
- We use diff to golden master test `head` with its original implementation.
